# Cafe Billing Application

The Cafe Billing Application is a simple Python program that allows a cafe owner or cashier to manage the cafe's menu, take orders from customers, and calculate bills based on different discounts, taxes, and service charges.

## Features
- Add new menu items with their respective prices.
- Display the current menu to the cashier/customer.
- Take orders for various menu items and their quantities.
- Calculate the total bill for the current order.
- Apply discounts to the bill based on a given percentage.
- Apply taxes to the bill based on a given percentage.
- Apply a service charge to the bill based on a given percentage.

## Code Structure

The code is divided into three classes: `MenuItem`, `OrderItem`, and `CafeBillingApplication`. Here's a brief overview of each class:

### `MenuItem` class
- Represents an item on the cafe's menu.
- Has two attributes: `name` (name of the item) and `price` (price of the item).

### `OrderItem` class
- Represents an item ordered by the customer.
- Takes a `menu_item` (an instance of `MenuItem`) and `quantity` as input.

### `CafeBillingApplication` class
- Manages the cafe's menu and takes care of billing and order management.
- Has the following methods:
  - `add_menu_item(name, price)`: Adds a new menu item to the cafe's menu.
  - `display_menu()`: Displays the current menu to the user.
  - `take_order()`: Allows the cashier to take orders from the customer.
  - `calculate_bill()`: Calculates the total bill for the current order.
  - `apply_discount(discount_percentage)`: Applies a discount to the total bill.
  - `apply_tax(tax_percentage)`: Applies taxes to the total bill.
  - `apply_service_charge(service_charge_percentage)`: Applies a service charge to the total bill.

Feel free to modify the code as per your specific requirements and expand the application with additional features if needed.
